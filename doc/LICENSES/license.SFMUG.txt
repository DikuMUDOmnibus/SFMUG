SFMUD is a merger of the Star Wars Reality codebase and Chronicles Codebase.
All licenses must be aheared to.

Also, Orion Elder requests that if you use the Chronicles codebase, that you go
to the MUD Planet MUD Forums (http://forums.mudplanet.org) and sign up. 

I don't make any warenties about anything. I ask that you send me an e-mail to my
current e-mail address letting me know that you are useing this code. If this e-mail
adress changes, please send one to the new address. When the SFMUG website is up,
go to there instead to inform me.
( lews00@yahoo.com )

A final note, plase read all other licences. This codebase is subject to all of them.
